Stick to the essentials and avoid unnecessary details that could clutter your resume. Highlight Achievements: Instead of just listing your responsibilities, focus on your accomplishments. Did you increase sales during your part-time job? Lead a successful project at school? Highlight these achievements to showcase your value. Use Action Verbs: Start each bullet point with a strong action verb to grab the employer's attention. Words like managed, developed, and implemented demonstrate your proactive approach.Include Relevant Keywords: Many employers use applicant tracking systems to scan resumes for specific keywords. Research industry-relevant terms and incorporate them into your resume to increase your chances of getting noticed. Quantify Your Impact: Whenever possible, include numbers and statistics to quantify your achievements. This adds credibility to your resume and gives employers a clear idea of your contributions.",
